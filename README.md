# Recipe Suggestion

## Overview
The Fridge Inventory Management project is a web application that allows users to manage their fridge contents and get recipe suggestions based on the available ingredients. The application uses a PostgreSQL database to store user inventory data and a Flask backend to handle the server-side logic.

## Features
- **Existing User Management**: Users can view and manage the contents of their existing fridge inventories.
- **New Fridge Setup**: Users can create a new fridge inventory by adding ingredients and their quantities.
- **Recipe Suggestions**: The application provides recipe suggestions based on the user's available ingredients, including both complete recipes and partial recipes that can be made with the current inventory.
